Obsolete, needs to be updated:

Applications that use the priv module, will check to see
that the current user is a valid postgres user.

If you are just getting started with a new, empty database, (like you're trying to run
the Wyseman sample schema) you may have the following "catch-22" problem:

- You have to run the employee information manager (emplim) to add new users
- You can't run emplim without being a current user
- So you can't get started

There is a script called "kickstart" that will add your first user and give him permission
emplim and priv permissions.  Run it as follows:

    ./kickstart username userid <dbname>

For example, to add user "bob" who's unix userid is 1234, accessing the database "mydb,"

    ./kickstart bob 1234 mydb
