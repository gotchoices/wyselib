Production Model

This is a schema for managing a production center.  Parts are organized in 
families which share a common base name.  A base describes a set of parts that 
share a common set of specifications and production documentation.  However, 
each part within the base family will differ according to one or more 
parameters.

For example, a family of zinc plated hex bolts might be described by a single 
base name.  But one part number might exist for a 3/8x16 bolt that is 1" long.  
Another part number is associated with a 3/x16 bolt that is 2" long.

Base names are created for manufactured pats as well as raw materials like the
bolt example above.  For example, a manufactured case might consist of a box,
a lid, and 4 bolts and nuts to attach the lid to the box.  In this example,
the parts that go into the product would be described by a bill of materials
(or BOM).

In addition to being described by a BOM, you might need to also describe 
several different operations to be performed on those materials.  For example, 
it might be necessary to punch holes in the lid first.  But the holes in the 
box might need to be drilled.  And before assembly, the box and lid might each 
need to be painted.  After attaching the lid, it may be necessary to inspect 
and place decals on the finished box.

The BOM will be written in TCL.  But it will be parsed by the database in
the back end.  After parsing, the BOM will be resolved into a distinct set
of components and procedures.  These lists will be cached in a table with one
instantiation for each defined part number within the product family.

#BOM Example:
oper assembly {
  part 1 o:decal(top)
  part 4 o:decal(side)
  oper 1 paint {
    oper 1 punch {
      part 1 o:lid
    }
  }
  oper 1 paint {
    oper 1 drill {
      part 1 o:box
    }
  }
  part 4 b:hex(10,32,1/2)
  part 4 b:nut(10,32)
}
