Class Table
#----------------------------------------------------------------
This table contains 'account classes' which form graft points where actual 
accounts would be grafted into a chart of accounts.  This facilitates the 
notion that transactions are grouped together into accounts, but those
accounts can appear in different locations in the financial reports based on
how the particular accounting method treats them.

It would also allow different entities to use a different type of chart of
accounts (as well as sharing one if that is what the user wants).

Classes would look like the upper level of the chart of accounts:
