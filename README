Wyselib is a schema library, part of the WyattERP application framework.

Wyseman (github.com/gotchoices/wyseman) is a framework for authoring and
managing schemas (sets of database objects) inside the PostgreSQL database.

This package provides a set of database objects that can be accessed by
wyseman to create the core of an ERP application.  This basic core can be
added upon with your own schema components to make a complete application.

Wyselib also includes a number of run-time tcl modules historically a part of
the ERP client applications themselves (written in Tcl/Tk).  These are not
needed for new application development in the browser using wylib
(github.com/gotchoices/wylib).  However, this library may eventually contain
javascript modules which will serve an analogous purpose.
