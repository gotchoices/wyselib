Simplified Accounting module

Overview
#----------------------------------------------------------------
The goal of this design is to simplify acct version 3 and to use more standard
terms for the various tables.

Each debit or credit is identified by two values:
 - account (required)
 - label (optional)

The account PK is a compound field consisting of:
  - entity
  - account code

The label is used for finer grained description of transactions such as (tax, 
materials, fuel, etc.) for example.

Accounts are organized hierarchically so each account has a parent.

Account Types
#----------------------------------------------------------------
  c Category
    This type is meant solely as a parent for grouping other accounts.
    Transactions should not be booked directly to this type.

    Each entity should have 5 top-level category accounts defined:
    Assets, Liabilities, Income, Expenses, Equity.  A top-level account has no
    parent specified.
	
  t	Transaction
	Normal transactions are booked to this type of account.

Labels
#----------------------------------------------------------------
Traditionally, expenses have been broken down into separate sub-accounts
representing the kind of thing the expense was for (such as fuel, travel, taxes 
and so forth).  There are a few problems with this approach.  First, there may be 
several higher level accounts for which this level of detail is also wanted (such 
as G&A, Warranty and COGS).  To track each of these kinds in a separate account 
requires creating numerous new account under each major expense account.

When individual expense kinds are tracked in individual accounts, budgeting
may also be impacted.  By setting individual budget amounts for fuel and lodging
it implies that a manager is authorized to spend more money only if it for a 
certain kind of thing.

A more difficult problem is that often these kinds are also applicable
to disbursements into balance sheet categorys such as Jobs in Process, Work in 
Process, Capital Equipment, inventory and so forth.  To create separate accounts
under each of these balance sheet accountss would unnecessarily complicate 
reconciliation and presentation.

We will maintain general expense categories such as COGS and overhead.
A separate label field will indicate the type as follows:

 Number     Description
    05      Salary and Wages
    10      Commissions
    15      Employment tax expense
    20      Legal
    25      Other professional contract
    30      Equipment lease and rentals
    35      Utilities
    40      Office supplies
    45      Tools & Equipment
    50      Bonding and insurance
    55      Materials
    60      Repairs and Maintenance
    65      Shipping expense
    70      Sales Tax
    75      Telecom
    80      Travel
    82      Lodging
    85      Per-diem expense
    90      Food & Entertainment
    95      Gas and other fuel

Ledgers
#----------------------------------------------------------------
There is a single general journal into which all transactions are entered
regardless of what sub-module they belong to.  Various views can be
constructed for accessing the general journal as a sub-journal or an account
specific ledger.  The general journal consists of a header table and an
item table.  Each balanced transaction will utilize one header and two or
more items (splits).

The journal header table contains:
  - Entity ID      \
  - Transaction ID /		#PK
  - Date			#Transaction date
  - Description
  - Module			#Hand entry, A/R, A/P, etc.
  - Posted			#True if locked into GL
  
The journal item table contains:
  - Entity ID      \
  - Transaction ID /		#FK to header table
  - Sequence (split 0 .. n)
  - Reference			#Check, invoice number etc.
  - Memo
  - Account ID 			#Entity,Account FK to accounts table
  - Label
  - Units			#Integer number of cents (or equivalent)
  - Reconciled			#FK into reconciliation table
  
Reconciliation
#----------------------------------------------------------------
Ledgers can be reconciled by referencing a document such as a bank statement.
This item is entered into a table with the following fields:

  - Entity ID
  - Account ID
  - Sequence
  - Memo			#Comments
  - Date			#Ending date for the statement
  - Units			#The balance
  
A journal item is included in the reconciliation by entering the sequence
number of the reconciliation item into the journal item 'reconciled' field.
