Account Table
#----------------------------------------------------------------
Each transaction is booked to an account which is always one of the standard
five accounting types.

   Asset
   Liability
   Equity
   Income
   Expense

There is a parent account to these 5 called "Entity," number 0.

Accounts are further organized in a hierarchical structure.  There should be 
one top-level (no parent) account named the same as each of the types shown
above.  Then, there can be sub accounts under each of them to create a chart
of accounts like the following (the numbers can be chosen differently):

       1  ast Assets
      10  cas  Current Assets
     100  chk    Checking			Project/sub-account

Categories
#----------------------------------------------------------------
Traditionally, expense categories have been broken down by the category
of the expense.  There are a few problems with this approach.  First, there
may be several higher level accounts in which this level of detail is wanted.
For example, both G&A and COGS may benefit from a detailed analysis of where
money is being spent.  To track each of these categories in a separate 
account requires creating numerous new account codes under each major 
expense category.

A more difficult problem is that often these categories are also applicable
to disbursements which will debit balance sheet accounts such as Jobs in 
Process, Work in Process, Capital Equipment and so forth.  To create separate
accounts under each of these balance sheet accounts would make it much more
difficult (if not impossible) to reconcile these accounts.  And yet, it is
often helpful to analyze the distribution of values in the various categories.

Therefore, we will avoid creating these divisions as accounts and will simply
maintain general expense accounts such as COGS and overhead.  A separate field
called "category" will contain a detail specification like the following:

    05      sawa	Salary and Wages
    10      comm	Commissions
    15      ptax	Employment tax expense
    20      lega	Legal
    25      prof	Other professional contract
    30      equi	Equipment lease and rentals
    35      util	Utilities
    40      osup	Office supplies
    45      tool	Tools & Equipment
    50      bond	Bonding and insurance
    55      matl	Materials
    60      repm	Repairs and Maintenance
    65      ship	Shipping expense
    70      stax	Sales Tax
    75      tele	Telecom
    80      trav	Travel
    82      lodg	Lodging
    85      diem	Per-diem expense
    90      food	Food & Entertainment
    95      fuel	Gas and other fuel

Categories have an alpha tag rather than a numeric one.  This will aid in
readability to distinguish category codes from account codes.

Projects
#----------------------------------------------------------------
Often it is desirable to divide accounting transactions by accountability.
There are several problems with using a separate account for each division
of accountability.  First problem is that an accountability center might
contain transactions to various different types of accounts (asset, 
liability, income, expense).  So to use accounts would necessitate creating
several accounts for each such center of activity (project).

By keeping a separate field for each project, projects can potentially
contain transactions for any type of account as well as all the various 
transaction categories.

Projects are maintained in a hierarchical structure.  The hierarchy is
meant to correspond to a supervisory structure within the enterprise.
An owner of a project has permissions to not only that project but also
all of its progeny.

Projects can also operate withing a fund granting framework where 
disbursements are not possible unless the project has sufficient funding.  
Funding can be granted and/or revoked by parent projects.

We an also use the project field to represent the notion of individual
business units, or entities.

The various project types should support the following:

hld	Holding
	This project can not have transactions booked directly to it, but
	rather serves as a place holder for other sub-projects.  There is
	a special holding project (0) which is the parent of all other 
	projects, and is the only project allowed to not have a parent 
	defined.
	
	Holding projects should be able to be used under an entity as well 
	to group other similar projects.  For example, we should be able
	to put a bunch of jobs under a holding project.  Once you have
	created a single child of a holding project, it should never be
	able to get a direct child of a different type.
	
ent	Entity (Business Unit)
	There should only be type 'hld' projects between this type and
	project 1.  Or this type of project can be a direct child of 1.
	
	Entity projects can have any type of child projects.  Typically
	though, they should have just a handful of holding projects (such
	as one for each administrative area of the company).
	Not subject to funding limitations.

bsh	Balance Sheet
	This project must have an account defined which serves as a pointer 
	to show where this project will appear on the balance sheet.
	This type of project can be used for such things as:
	    inventory
	    bank accounts
	    loans, credit lines
	    capital assets
	    credit cards
	This type may need to be broken out into individual types.
	Not subject to funding limitations.

job	Percent Completion Job
	Project should contain only income and expense accounts.  Revenue
	can be accrued on a percent-completion basis by attributing an
	expected margin to each accrued expense.
	Subject to funding limitations.

jip	Contract Completion Job
	Project should contain only income and expense transactions.  
	As long as the job is open, all income will accrue to deposits
	(liability) and all costs will accrue to jobs in process (asset).
	Upon contract completion, the accrued cost will be credited 
	back off of the balance sheet and debited to COGS.  Payments will
	be credited to sales.
	Subject to funding limitations.

ots	Project is for sales revenues and cogs expenses for products sold
	off-the-shelf.  Revenues and costs will accrue at the moment of
	completion of each order.
	Subject to funding limitations.

sub	Project can be under any other type of project for the purpose of
	aiding in management or accountability.  However, for purposes of
	financial reporting, transactions in this type of project will
	appear in their parent project.
	Subject to funding limitations.

adm	Project should contain primarily expenses which will accrue to
	G&A expense.  Income may be optionally be applied if it is of a
	nature to offset overhead expenses.
	Subject to funding limitations.


GL Encoding
#----------------------------------------------------------------
Each GL entry should include:

    Trans_ID:		A unique ID for the transaction
    Entity:		The ID of the lowest entity project above my project
    Project:		The project this transaction belongs to
    Account:		The account
    Category:		Disbursement category
    Date:		Transaction Date
    Debit:		Debit amount if any
    Credit:		Credit amount if any
    Amount:		Net amount

When running reports, full account codes will be rendered as a concatenation of
the components: entity, account, project, category.  For example:

    3.50.1234.fuel		
    3.cgs.2345.repm	full account code
    3.cgs..rep		project suppressed for income statement
    3.400.3456		no category applicable

Module Specifics
#----------------------------------------------------------------
Each module must store information as required about the project, account, 
and category applicable to each transaction.  In some cases, the account
may be determined from the context of the project.  In some cases, a
category may not be necessary.  For example:

entered:	This must be entered for each transaction
default:	A default can be guessed but may be over-written
known:		The value can always be determined from the project
constant:	The module always produces the same value
N/A:		No value is stored

Module		Project		Account		Category	Extensions
AP		entered		default		entered
cash		entered		known		constant
payroll		entered		default		entered
withholding	entered		default		entered
material	project		known		constant
AR		entered		default		default

Extensions
#----------------------------------------------------------------
Some balance sheet accounts are reconciled by a detail other than a project 
number.  For example a part-number based inventory must be sub-dividable 
into accounts for each separate part number.  Work in Process must be 
dividable into individual work order items.  A Capital Asset project must be 
dividable by Asset ID numbers.

This implies that all transactions must be capable of storing these additional 
fields.  Each such extension field should be required (non-null) if the 
project type demands it and forbidden (null) otherwise.
